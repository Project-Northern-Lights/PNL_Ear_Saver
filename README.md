# Project Northern Lights' Ear Savers
====================================
#### A simple, 3d-printable ear saver design with branding for projectnorthernlights.ca 

#### Settings:
- Nozzle Diameter: 0.5mm (Match this to your printer's nozzle, most printers by default have a nozzel with 0.4mm diameter )
- Layer Height: 0.3mm
- Infill: 0% 
- bottom layers: 2
- Top Layers: 3

The model is designed to be 5 layers at 0.3mm per layer and have no infill. 
If you print at a different layer thickness you will need to adjust the number of top/bottom layers for it to print solid with no infill
